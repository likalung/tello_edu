This is a example of tello edu swarm.

Before you start:
1. Before you use this file, you need to install the pygame for music play in the python.you can refer to https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted for how to install pygame.
2. Set all the tello mac address in to the router and give a fixed ip address for them. So everytime you play, you can easily know the which tello you use. I use 101 as the started IP address for first tello. so the second tello will be 102.

Choosing mode:
You can use continue IP address's tello edu (set uselist as 0) or randomly choose tello edu as you like, just put the tello number in to the tellolist and set uselist as 1.
